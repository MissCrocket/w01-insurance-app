    "scenario": "Maria is opening a new café. She's invested her life savings into it. She's worried about a fire destroying her new kitchen equipment (a pure risk) and also about whether her café will be popular enough to make a profit (a speculative risk). To protect her investment, she speaks to an insurance broker.",
    "questions": [
      {
        "question": "Which of Maria's risks is insurable and why?",
        "answer": "The risk of a fire is insurable because it is a pure risk – there is no chance of financial gain, only loss. The risk of the café not being profitable is a speculative risk and is not insurable."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the primary benefit of Maria buying insurance for her kitchen equipment?",
        "answer": "The primary benefit is risk transfer. She transfers the large, uncertain financial risk of a fire to the insurer in exchange for a smaller, certain premium. This gives her peace of mind and protects her savings."
