    "title": "Case Study: The Classic Car",
    "scenario": "Ahmed restores a vintage car that he co-owns with his sister, Fatima. They both contribute to its upkeep. Ahmed takes out an insurance policy in his name only for the full market value of the car. A month later, before Fatima has been added to the policy, the car is stolen from a locked garage. The insurer questions whether Ahmed can claim for the full value of the car.",
    "questions": [
      {
        "question": "Does Ahmed have insurable interest in the car, and if so, to what extent?",
        "answer": "Yes, Ahmed has insurable interest as a part-owner. Legally, he can insure the property for its full value because, as a co-owner, he is considered a trustee for his sister's share. He has a legal right to insure arising out of a financial relationship with the car."
      },
      {
        "question": "When did insurable interest need to exist for Ahmed's policy to be valid?",
        "answer": "For general insurance, such as a motor policy, insurable interest must exist at the time the policy is taken out and, crucially, at the time of the loss. Since Ahmed was still a co-owner when the car was stolen, the requirement is met."
