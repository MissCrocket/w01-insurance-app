      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Providing financial compensation to place the policyholder in the same position as immediately before the loss",
      "explanation": "Core definition: restore, not improve, the policyholder’s financial position (subject to policy terms/limits)."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Buildings (restoring to pre-loss condition)",

      "concept": "New-for-old",
      "question": "‘New for old’ cover typically:",

      "concept": "First-loss",
      "question": "A first-loss policy:",
      "options": [
        "Insures for total value and offers a large premium discount",
        "Insures for less than full value where total loss is improbable",
        "Always attracts average condition",
        "Is the same as agreed value"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Insures for less than full value where total loss is improbable",
      "explanation": "Premium saving is modest as the insurer still pays all individual claims up to the first-loss limit."

      "concept": "Agreed value",
      "question": "An agreed value clause most closely means:",

        "The insurer will agree any claim value proposed by the policyholder",
        "A fixed sum is pre-agreed for the insured item for claim purposes",
        "Payment is always actual cash value",
        "Average will always apply"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A fixed sum is pre-agreed for the insured item for claim purposes",

        "$40,000",
        "$10,000"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "$30,000",
      "explanation": "Average reduces the claim in the same proportion as underinsurance (0.75 × $40,000 = $30,000)."
    },
    {
      "type": "mcq",
      "concept": "Deductible / excess",
      "question": "A deductible (excess) of $500 generally means:",

        "$2,500 is the maximum payable (before any excess)",
        "Nothing is payable",
        "Average will increase the payment"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "$2,500 is the maximum payable (before any excess)",
      "explanation": "Item/single-article limits cap the insurer’s liability for certain items."
