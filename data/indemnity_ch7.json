      "question": "A first-loss policy:",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Insures for less than full value where total loss is improbable",
      "explanation": "Premium saving is modest as the insurer still pays all individual claims up to the first-loss limit."

      "options": [
        "The full £6,000 is payable",
        "£2,500 is the maximum payable (before any excess)",
        "Nothing is payable as it was underinsured",
        "The insurer will pay for a replacement of lesser value"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "£2,500 is the maximum payable (before any excess)",
