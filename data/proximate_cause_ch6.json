  "questions": [
    {
      "type": "mcq",
      "concept": "Definition",
      "question": "In insurance, 'proximate cause' generally refers to the:",
      "options": [
        "Last event in the chain of events",
        "Dominant, effective cause of the loss",
        "First event in the chain of events",
        "Any insured peril mentioned in the policy"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Dominant, effective cause of the loss",
      "explanation": "Proximate cause is the dominant, efficient cause that sets the chain of events in motion and determines liability."
    },
    {
      "type": "mcq",
      "concept": "Excepted peril",
      "question": "Where the peril identified as the proximate cause is an excepted (excluded) peril:",
      "options": [
        "The claim is still payable at the insurer’s discretion",
        "The claim fails",
        "Only 50% is payable",
        "The claim must be referred to reinsurance"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "The claim fails",
      "explanation": "If the proximate cause of loss is excluded by the policy, the insurer is not liable."
    },
    {
      "type": "mcq",
      "concept": "Uninsured/unnamed peril",
      "question": "An uninsured (unnamed) peril that is the proximate cause will:",
      "options": [
        "Always be treated as insured",
        "Be treated as excluded by default",
        "Lead to a payable claim only on 'all risks' wording",
        "Be ignored in favour of the nearest insured peril"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Lead to a payable claim only on 'all risks' wording",
      "explanation": "Named perils policies respond only to specified perils; 'all risks' wordings may cover unnamed perils subject to exclusions."
    },
    {
      "type": "mcq",
      "concept": "Concurrent causes",
      "question": "If two causes operate together to produce a loss and one is insured and the other excluded, the usual approach is:",
      "options": [
        "Pay the claim because one cause was insured",
        "Decline the claim if the excluded peril is the proximate (dominant) cause",
        "Split the claim 50/50",
        "Refer to subrogation to resolve"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Decline the claim if the excluded peril is the proximate (dominant) cause",
      "explanation": "Liability turns on which cause is dominant (proximate). If the excluded peril is proximate, the claim fails."
    },
    {
      "type": "mcq",
      "concept": "Chain of events",
      "question": "A storm blows a roof off; hours later rain enters and damages stock. Which is most likely the proximate cause?",
      "options": [
        "Rain (water ingress)",
        "Storm",
        "Humidity",
        "Faulty construction"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Storm",
      "explanation": "Where the time gap is short and the loss flows naturally from the storm damage, storm remains the dominant cause."
    },
    {
      "type": "mcq",
      "concept": "Intervening cause",
      "question": "A fire is followed days later by looting that causes the main loss. The looting is likely considered:",
      "options": [
        "A remote cause, fire proximate",
        "An intervening proximate cause",
        "A contributing but irrelevant cause",
        "An excepted peril by default"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "An intervening proximate cause",
      "explanation": "A significant time interval and a new, independent event can break the chain, making the later event proximate."
    },
    {
      "type": "mcq",
      "concept": "Sole cause wording",
      "question": "If a policy states it will respond only where fire is the 'sole cause' of loss, then where two causes operate concurrently:",
      "options": [
        "The claim is valid if fire is one cause",
        "The claim fails unless fire is the only cause",
        "The claim always succeeds if fire is insured",
        "The claim is split between causes"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "The claim fails unless fire is the only cause",
      "explanation": "Sole cause wording modifies proximate cause by requiring the insured peril to be the only cause."
    },
    {
      "type": "mcq",
      "concept": "Wide exclusion wording",
      "question": "Policy states: 'Loss caused directly or indirectly by flood is excluded.' If flood (excluded) leads to fire (insured) that causes the damage, the likely outcome is:",
      "options": [
        "Claim is payable because fire did the damage",
        "Claim is excluded",
        "Insurer must pay part subject to average",
        "Payable only if sum insured is adequate"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Claim is excluded",
      "explanation": "Broad exclusions can remove cover even where the excluded peril contributes indirectly to the loss."
    },
    {
      "type": "mcq",
      "concept": "Excepted peril chain",
      "question": "If any event in the chain is an excepted peril and is found to be proximate:",
      "options": [
        "The claim is still payable if premium was fully paid",
        "The claim fails",
        "The claim is reduced by the excess",
        "The claim triggers contribution"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "The claim fails",
      "explanation": "If the excepted peril is proximate, there is no liability."

      "type": "fill",
      "concept": "Term recall",
      "question": "The dominant, efficient cause of loss is called the ________ cause.",
      "correctAnswer": ["proximate"],
      "explanation": "Recall of the core definition."
    },
    {
      "type": "mcq",
      "concept": "Policy wording importance",
      "question": "Which statement best reflects the role of policy wording in proximate cause?",
      "options": [
        "Wording never changes the proximate cause outcome",
        "Wording can modify outcomes (e.g., sole cause, wide exclusions)",
        "Only schedules, not wordings, affect cause",
        "Excess size determines cause"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Wording can modify outcomes (e.g., sole cause, wide exclusions)",
      "explanation": "Specific wordings can alter how concurrent or indirect causes are treated."
    },
    {
      "type": "mcq",
      "concept": "Named perils vs all risks",
      "question": "A 'named perils' policy will usually respond when:",
      "options": [
        "Any peril operates",
        "An insured peril is established as proximate",
        "A peril is not mentioned but seems fair",
        "The policyholder’s intent is clear"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "An insured peril is established as proximate",
      "explanation": "Liability depends on the insured peril being the dominant cause under named-perils cover."

  "flashcards": [
    { "term": "Proximate Cause", "definition": "The dominant, effective cause of a loss; determines if a policy responds." },

    { "term": "Concurrent Causes", "definition": "Two causes acting together; the dominant one governs liability unless wording alters the result." },
    { "term": "Sole Cause Wording", "definition": "Requires the insured peril to be the only cause for cover to apply." },
