    "scenario": "A company owns a building worth £1 million. It has two separate fire insurance policies on the building: one with Insurer A for a sum insured of £750,000 and another with Insurer B for a sum insured of £500,000. A fire causes £100,000 of damage. The company claims the full £100,000 from Insurer A, as the loss is well within their sum insured.",
    "questions": [
      {
        "question": "Can the company claim the full £100,000 from Insurer A? What right does Insurer A have?",
        "answer": "Yes, in the absence of a specific policy condition, the company can claim the full amount from either insurer. However, Insurer A has the right of contribution. This allows them to call upon Insurer B to share the cost of the claim, as both policies cover the same interest, subject-matter, and peril."
      },
      {
        "question": "How will the two insurers share the £100,000 loss?",
        "answer": "They will share it in proportion to their sums insured. The total sum insured is £1,250,000 (£750,000 + £500,000). Insurer A's share is (£750,000 / £1,250,000) = 60%. Insurer B's share is (£500,000 / £1,250,000) = 40%. Therefore, Insurer A will pay £60,000 and can recover £40,000 from Insurer B."

      "explanation": "For contribution to apply, five conditions are needed: 1) Two or more policies of indemnity; 2) Common insurable interest; 3) Common peril; 4) Common subject-matter; 5) Each policy must be liable for the loss. The sums insured do not need to be identical."
