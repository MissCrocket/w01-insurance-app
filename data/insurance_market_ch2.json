    "scenario": "A specialist engineering firm, 'InnovateMech', has developed a new, high-value piece of manufacturing equipment. The risk is significant, and their primary insurer can only take on 60% of the value. InnovateMech's broker advises that the risk needs to be spread. The broker approaches a syndicate at Lloyd's and another specialist insurer to cover the remaining 40%. After a major fire, InnovateMech's managing director appoints an expert to help prepare and negotiate the complex claim.",
